# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I install the mod?
**Please view our installation video below, or [click here for a text guide.](https://lotusau.top/rd/install)**

[![How to install the Project: Lotus Mod! (2025)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3HXW4ceKaac/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HXW4ceKaac)

### Can I <u>download</u> this mod on Mobile?
As of right now, **no.**<br>
> The people at **All Of Us: AU Mods** are working on an Android Mod launcher, Project: Lotus will be compatible with it at launch, and this will be updated when more information is available.

## What do the different things in the releases mean? / How do I update the mod?
Here's a Quick Explanation -
- **HatUpdate.zip** means there was new Custom Hats added to the mod, these go in your `AmongUs/BepInEx/plugins` folder and will replace the `lotushats.bundle` and `lotushats.catalog` files.

- **Lotus.dll & VentFrameworkContinued.dll** mean there was an update to the mod itself, these go into your `AmongUs/BepInEx/plugins` folder and will replace the previous ones.
  - Note, **VentFrameworkContinued** is required, but a new release may not include it, this means that the previous version can still be used.
  - If either of these are not included in the release, that means there was a mod-breaking update, and you need to install the `Lotus[Version]-[Platform].zip` update. Please make sure to install the correct platform that you are on.


- **lang_[Language].yaml** or **TranslationUpdate.zip** means that there was an update to the mod's translations, these files will go into `AmongUs/Languages/Lotus`

- **Lotus-[Version]-MicrosoftStoreOnly.zip & Lotus-[Version]-Steam+Epic.zip** are included in every release, these are the files to install the mod if you haven't already. 
  - Occasionally a release may not have a .dll file, which means you'll need to download one of these & [reinstall](#how-do-i-install-the-mod) the mod.

### Updating when there's no .dll file.
- Back up your `AmongUs/BepInEx/config` folder, as that's where your settings are stored. Also back up your `LOTUS_DATA` folder if you've made any changes to your Templates, or have given people titles.
- Once those are backed up, delete the `BepInEx` and `dotnet` folders, and reinstall the mod by installing the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Lotus-AU/LotusContinued/releases/latest). Then copy the contents of the **.zip** file into your `Among Us` folder. You can then restore the backed up stuff.
- <u><b>If there was an Among Us Update & Your modded files are separated from your Vanilla files, you'll want to copy your Vanilla files into your Modded folder to update your game.</b></u>


## How can I make my lobby public / Why aren't people joining my lobby?
Vanilla (Non-Modded) players are unable to see your lobby in the in-game matchmaker as of June 2023.
- This was due to a change Innersloth did to their anti-cheat, but Host-Only mods got caught in the crossfire.

#### What can I do then?
We have a bot in our Discord, [**Lilypad**](https://lotusau.top/en/lilypad), which will automatically post your lobby in a channel once it is made public.
You can also view Active Public Lobbies in [**our lobby viewer.**](https://lotusau.top/lobbies/)

Nothing else can be done, as Innersloth needs to make the change.

## Why do I get randomly kicked?
As of April 4th, 2025: Innersloth, the developers of Among Us, have made changes to their server-side anti-cheat which may cause players to be kicked. 
- Please try to report any instances of this happening in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/projectlotus)
- If you're constantly being kicked, then try using [Modded Regions](https://lotusau.top/regions), as these regions are not subjected to the same changes.

## Why do I keep getting black-screened?
The cause of this is usually ping. We do a lot to try to prevent blackscreens but in the end they may sometimes happen.
- You may fix blackscreens by telling the host of the lobby to use the `/fix` command on you.
  - Usage: (If you blackscreen on game start): `/fix (player_id) start` | (If you blackscreen after meeting): `/fix (player_id)`
  - (Player ID's can be obtained with the `/ids` command.)
